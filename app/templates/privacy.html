                        <p>This application uses the data for two basic purposes: to facilitate team discovery and coordination, and to send communications.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Profile Information: Your name and profile image are visible to your teammates.</li>
                            <li>Email: Your email is visible to your team captain. We may send you emails about this year's event at the email address associated with your account. Only with your explicit permission will we use the address to inform you about future events.</li>
                            <li>Uploaded Content: Images you upload are visible to your teammates. If your team shares the secret gallery link, they can be browsed by users without accounts.</li>
